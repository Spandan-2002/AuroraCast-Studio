# üåå AuroraCast Studio

AuroraCast Studio is a reimagined audio workspace for creators who want AI-native tooling without losing editorial control. The interface blends a strategic "Creator Cockpit" with momentum insights, trending voice textures, and a refreshed listening surface so you can move from idea to published show in a single flow.

> **Why this rebuild?** The original Podcastr template has been redesigned from the ground up: new branding, navigation, information architecture, and data visualisations turn it into a creator-first dashboard rather than a simple listing app.

## ‚ú® Highlights
- **Creator Cockpit:** A glassmorphism toolbar summarises output velocity, listener minutes, and gives jump-in shortcuts to the AI studio.
- **Momentum Insights:** A context panel surfaces trending episodes, rising creators, and session blueprints tailored to your account state.
- **Voice Texture Board:** Discover the standout episodes for each AI voice model with one-click previews.
- **Heroic Launchpad:** The homepage hero spotlights the strongest performing story while giving instant access to creation tools.
- **Responsive top navigation:** Consolidated control centre with global search, quick actions, and Clerk authentication.

## üß™ Suggested QA Checklist

- Record or upload a sample episode, then refresh the overview to see it in "Fresh uploads".
- Test the global search in the header and the Discover page debounce search.
- Verify the audio player still pins to the bottom across routes.

## üó∫Ô∏è Roadmap Ideas
- Inline episode edits with waveform annotations in the studio.
- Collaborative sessions with presence indicators driven by Convex actions.
- Advanced analytics (retention curves, top listener segments).
- Native theming (light mode / accent presets) with persisted preference.
